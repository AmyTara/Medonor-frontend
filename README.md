Welcome to ME-DONOR_FRONTEND 🚑✌
Our project aims to counter two problems.

💨one faced by NGO(s) workers searching for particular medicines
💨for donors to look for NGOs eager to use the unused medicienes to distribute among needy people.

It will cut back the need to go to different hospitals/medicine providers for medicines. The shop-vendors/individual can directly learn from the website and contact that person/shop. It makes the process effortless, attracting more people to volunteer for the organization.
