                            50 million Indians don’t take their prescribed medication 
                            because they can’t afford it. With soaring copays, deductibles, 
                            and insurance costs, many people are making impossible choices 
                            between medications, food and housing, gas to get to work, 
                            and more. Not taking your medications, however, often leads to 
                            even worse outcomes—heart attacks, strokes, and even higher costs. 
                            This is our nation’s most critical problem, but it doesn’t have 
                            to be. That’s why we’re here. MEDONOR provides access so everyone 
                            gets the care they deserve.
